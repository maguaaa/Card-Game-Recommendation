# Final Project Proposal

## Data Source 

- using API key: https://api.rawg.io/api/games
- scrapying: https://store.steampowered.com/search/results

## Data Processing
- **Web API you haven’t used before that requires API key or HTTP Basic authorization ✣ (4pts)**
    -  https://api.rawg.io/api/games
Access and cache the data in **RAWG**. I will try to get different types of information, such as name, ratings, platform, genres, etc.

- **Crawling [and scraping] multiple pages in a site you haven’t used before ✣ (8 pts)**
    - https://store.steampowered.com/search/results
I will scrape data from **Steam store** to get some data of video games (url, price, etc.).


## Data Interaction & Presentation

*A VIDEO GAME RECOMMENDATION PROGRAM*

Design a question tree to help usesrs to choose their games of interest. For example, the root question: what is your favourite platform? In the next level, what gener of game do you prefer? And so on.

Eventually, there will be a list of games with pictures and urls popping out.
